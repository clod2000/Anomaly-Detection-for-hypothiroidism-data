# Anomaly Detection for Hypothyroidism Data

This repository contains the code, data, and results for the project **"Anomaly Detection for Hypothyroidism Data"**, completed as part of the Unsupervised Learning exam.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore unsupervised techniques for anomaly detection on a hypothyroidism dataset. The repository includes:

- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Implementation of various clustering and outlier detection algorithms (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, LOF, etc.)
- Use of Gower distance for mixed data types
- Visualization and analysis of results

All code and experiments are documented in the provided Jupyter notebooks.

## Collaboration

This project was developed in collaboration with **Diego Pesce**.
